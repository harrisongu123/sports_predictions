# Betting Against Vegas

## Author: Harrison Gu

## Overview

As the sports betting industry is gaining steam, we are interested in selling NBA spread picks to sports bettors via subcription to our service. We will use regression models to predict outcomes of NBA games. Our goal is to make a prediction on the spreads (point differential) of each game, and use that information to bet against the Vegas spread. Because Vegas typically takes a 10% rake for each bet, we have to be able to beat Vegas 52.5% of the time in order to be profitable.
